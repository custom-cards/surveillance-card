## Installation

### Step 1

Install `surveillance-card` by copying `surveillance-card.js`, `record.svg`, and `snapshot.svg` from this repo to `<config directory>/www/surveillance-card/` on your Home Assistant instance.

**Example:**

```bash
mkdir <config directory>/www/surveillance-card/
cd <config directory>/www/surveillance-card/

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-cards/surveillance-card/master/surveillance-card.js
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-cards/surveillance-card/master/record.svg
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/custom-cards/surveillance-card/master/snapshot.svg
```

### Step 2

Link `surveillance-card` inside you `ui-lovelace.yaml`.

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/surveillance-card.js?v=0
    type: module
```

### Step 3

Add as custom card of a panel view in your `ui-lovelace.yaml` using `type: custom:surveillance-card`

## Example
```yaml
views:
  - title: Surveillance
    icon: mdi:cctv
    panel: true
    cards:
      - type: custom:surveillance-card
        thumb_interval: 15
        update_interval: 2
        recording_duration: 10
        show_capture_buttons: true
        cameras:
          - entity: camera.front_porch
            motion_entity: binary_sensor.front_porch_motion
          - entity: camera.back_yard
            motion_entity: binary_sensor.back_yard_motion
          - entity: camera.driveway
```

## Saving Snapshots from Cameras

Clicking on the *camera button* will save a single snapshot from that camera.

Clicking the *record button* will grab as many images as it can (based on the update intervals) for the set `recording_duration`

Note: This functionality is not available in native app versions (iOS & Android) and depends on the browser/device's ability to download image files.
