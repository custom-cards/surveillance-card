## Saving Snapshots from Cameras

Clicking on the *camera button* will save a single snapshot from that camera.

Clicking the *record button* will grab as many images as it can (based on the update intervals) for the set `recording_duration`

Note: This functionality is not available in native app versions (iOS & Android) and depends on the browser/device's ability to download image files.
